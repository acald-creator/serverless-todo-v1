# Serverless TODO Application

This is a sample of a serverless todo app. I had written up a couple of different ones, one namely from when I first started working on a project from Udacity Cloud Developer curriculum. Sadly, I never finished the program but I did continue working on the Serverless project as a learning process for me.

It is a work in progress, and will be finished some time soon once I complete the app development and create a blog and/or tutorial.
